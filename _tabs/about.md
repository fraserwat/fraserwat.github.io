After I finished my masters degree in Data Science, I wanted to put together a couple of projects adjacent to the area of my final research project to give me some code examples I could point at in interviews (it would be unwise to make my project code public before graduation in May 2025).

My final project was on Recommender Systems (specifically the application of [an algorithm from a recent paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08868) to "real world" datasets), so a few RS implementations walking through my thought process would probably be a good use of my time. Maybe I'll also find other stuff to write about -- who knows!

I have 10 years experience in the "data" industry (broadly defined), and I've been a contractor since mid-2021. Mix of single-digit headcount startups and multinational tech giants, and everything in between. My email is at the bottom of the page, or you can [hit me up on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fraser-watt/).

In my spare time I play guitar (predominantly metal), dabble in weightlifting, and explore the 1000's of restaurants across London.
